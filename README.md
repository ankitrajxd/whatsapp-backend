# Fullstack Chat WhatsApp Backend

This project is a backend server for a real-time chat application inspired by WhatsApp. It is built using Node.js, Express, TypeScript, MongoDB (with Mongoose), and Zod for validation. The backend provides APIs and real-time communication features to support user authentication, messaging, and chat management.

**Note:** This project is currently in progress. The README and documentation will be updated as development continues.
